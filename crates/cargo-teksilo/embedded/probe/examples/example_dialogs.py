"""Overlay lifecycle: where a dialog actually *is*, and who has focus.

Drives a live `cargo run -p dialogs-and-popovers` and proves five things about
overlays that a probe has to know before it can assert anything about one:

1. **A `Dialog` is not necessarily an overlay.** Teksilo resolves a modal
   through `ModalPresentation::Auto`, and on a backend that supports native
   modal child windows it opens a real OS **window**. `get_overlays` stays
   empty and a default `snapshot_tree` still shows the parent — so a probe that
   looks in either place concludes the dialog never opened. `list_windows` is
   where it is, and every read after that needs `window_id=`.
2. **Focus moves into the modal, onto its declared default button**, via
   `ModalRequest::focus_target` + `Widget::initial_focus_hint`.
3. **Dismissing returns focus to the trigger** that opened it.
4. **Escape dismisses a `MessageBox`** — and the app's own result readout
   records `escape=true`, so the escape button really fired rather than the
   window merely vanishing.
5. **An in-tree `Popover` is the other shape**: `get_overlays` counts it, focus
   moves into its content, Escape dismisses it and focus comes back. And the
   two-press rule — an outside press dismisses the overlay *without* reaching
   the control beneath — holds for a **direct** pointer (touch / pen) and not
   for a mouse. See `two_press_leg`.

Why this needs a live app: presentation is resolved at runtime against the
window system, so which of these shapes you get is not visible in the source at
all. Only a running app on this host can say.

    python3 example_dialogs.py [--binary PATH] [--keep]

Exit codes: 0 every check passed, 1 the probe could not run, 2 it ran cleanly
and the behaviour is absent. See `teksilo_probe.report`.

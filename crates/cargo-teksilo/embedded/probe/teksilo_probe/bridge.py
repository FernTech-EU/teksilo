"""Launching the app, and finding the automation bridge it publishes.

A debug build with the `automation` feature and
`.install_automation_bridge_in_debug()` binds an endpoint, writes an
**endpoint descriptor**, spawns its accept thread, and only then announces
itself on stderr::

    teksilo-automation: bridge endpoint = /run/user/1000/teksilo-automation/1234.sock
    teksilo-automation: descriptor = /run/user/1000/teksilo-automation/1234.json
    TEKSILO_AUTOMATION_TOKEN=<uuid>

**Discovery reads the descriptor, not the announce.** The prototype harness this
generalises scraped stderr, and 0.9.3 renamed `bridge socket = ` to
`bridge endpoint = ` — every probe's regex missed it, waited the full 60-second
timeout, and reported "no bridge socket" for an app whose bridge was up the
whole time. The descriptor's *path* is a published contract
(`<runtime dir>/teksilo-automation/<pid>.json`) and its schema is versioned, so
polling it by the pid we spawned depends on nothing that can be reworded.

The announce is still parsed, as a fallback for an older app and for a bridge
found from a log rather than a process we started. Both spellings are accepted,
because the rename is exactly the kind of thing that happens again.

Pin the token before launching (`launch()` does) and the fallback is never
needed for a process we own: we know the pid and we know the token, so there is
nothing left to scrape.
